            <h3>MI Data Insights Project</h3>
            <ul class="project-achievements">
              <li>
                Successfully planned and implemented a new MI report across the
                entire client base, optimising performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analysing data sets to ensure that I had a range of reporting
                that would provide a one size fits all approach across a diverse
                client base.
              </li>
              <li>
                Resulted in a 13% increase in fraud detection for a specific
                client, derived from sector-wide analysis.
              </li>

            <h3>Client Retention</h3>
            <ul class="project-achievements">
              <li>
                Improved client retention, increasing the portfolio average term
                to 20 months (10 clients average, longest term 5 years)
              </li>
              <li>
                Being able to understand client value and working towards a
                common metric that was achievable, I successfully formed success
                plans to hit those metrics to prove the value of our service.
                This in turn led to better retention conversation due to proof
                of product value.
